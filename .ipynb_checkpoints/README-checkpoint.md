# PhysBryk

Small robust microcontroller and sensors for conducting high school physics investigations based on the [Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Sense](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-sense/overview).

The aim is to implement this in circuitpython see [Adafruit BLE Adafruit Library ](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/ble_adafruit/en/latest/#) and [Testing Bluetooth Low Energy Peripherals using a Python Script](https://punchthrough.com/bluetooth-low-energy-peripheral-testing/)

Web app is [here on glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/physbryk)

Circuit diagrams and other stuff [here on lucidchart](https://lucid.app/invitations/accept/f6d50b76-4089-42c6-90ed-853e881d3e9f)

For the Arduino version see [PhysBrykC](https://github.com/Geoffysicist/PhysBrykC)

TODO documentation - see [Circuitpython Design Guide](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/design_guide.html)
