# PhysBryk

Small robust microcontroller and sensors for conductinh high school physics investigations based on the [Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Sense](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-sense/overview) or the [Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/nano-33-ble-sense) and utilising the [Arduino Science Journal](https://science-journal.arduino.cc/) and the [associated libraries](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_ScienceJournal)

Might be able to implement this in circuitpython see [this stuff](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-ble-wireless-morse-code-chat?view=all#overview)

Also perhaps use an [Adafruit CLUE](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-nrf52-feather-learning-guide/bluefruit-nrf52-api) with [this guide to the use of bluetooth](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-nrf52-feather-learning-guide/bluefruit-nrf52-api)
