# PhysBryk

Small robust microcontroller and sensors for conducting high school physics investigations based on the [Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Sense](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-sense/overview).

The aim is to implement this in circuitpython see [this stuff](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-ble-wireless-morse-code-chat?view=all#overview)

For the Arduino version see [PhysBrykC](https://github.com/Geoffysicist/PhysBrykC)
